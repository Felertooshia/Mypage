            <h4> Who Am I?</h4>
            <p style="line-height: 1.8em;">I received my master’s degree in German Literature in 2013. I proudly published my first translated book "Sturm und Drang" Play by Friedrich Maximilian Klinger in 2017. Prior to my advanced German studies, I completed Architectural Drafting diploma and design courses which lead to my background in construction marketing.<br>I have worked as a Construction Marketing Specialist for over a decade. After my maternity leave in 2019, I decided to switch up my careers and pursue my dream job.
            <br><br>I vividly remember how excited I was when I got to have my first computer in 1996! I was fascinated to learn everything about that magic box that has a simple black page; my love and passion for programming grew from those early days. And here I am, creating and designing websites and enjoying every aspect of it!  
            <br>
            <br>In March 2020, I was selected to be one of the 25 women of boot camp program called ‘She Codes Plus’ in 2020.
            In 6 months, I have learnt to code with Python, Django, React JS, HTML and CSS. This program has given me the opportunity to meet amazing people in tech and tools to pursue my passion. It showed me the power of programming to transform and improve the lives of people around the world.
            I continually learn web technologies and other design related topics. <br>Some of my skills in design and development area include:</p>
                <ul class="b">
                    <li>HTML/CSS, Python, JavaScript, Django and React JS </li>
                    <li>Dot Net Nuke, Mura CMS, Drupal, Magnolia, Contents</li>
                    <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
                    <li>CRM Software (SAP)</li>
                    <li>Photoshop and InDesign</li>
                </ul>            
            <p style="line-height: 1.8em;">
            In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, lots of reading specially biographies, listening to podcasts and trying new sports.<br>I am currently based in Perth, Western Australia, and am excited for all the new opportunities the coding world has to offer. I very much look forward to contributing to our local industry!
