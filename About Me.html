                    <p style="line-height: 1.8em;">I vividly remember how excited I was when I got to have my first computer in 1996! I was fascinated to learn everything about that magic box that has a simple black page; my love and passion for programming grew from those early days. And here I am, creating and designing websites and enjoying every aspect of it!  
                        I learned coding through completing a six months’ boot camp program called ‘She Codes Plus’ in 2020. I continually learn web technologies and other design related topics, currently exploring JavaScript and JQuery. Some of my skills in design and development area include:

                            <ol>Responsive Web Design</ol>

                            <ol>Photoshop and InDesign</ol>

                    <p style="line-height: 1.8em;"> Before starting my career in Marketing, I received my master’s degree in German Literature. I proudly published my first translated book in 2017. Prior to my advanced German studies, I completed Architectural Drafting courses which lead to my background in construction marketing.</p>

                        <p style="line-height: 1.8em;">I am currently based in Perth, Western Australia, and am excited for all the new opportunities the coding world has to offer. I very much look forward to contributing to our local industry!
