        <meta name="description"content="I have worked as a Construction Marketing Specialist/Manager for over a decade. After having my little boy in Summer (Australia Time) of 2017, I decided to switch careers and pursue my dream job.
        I vividly remember how excited I was when I got to have my first computer in 1996! I was fascinated to learn everything about that magic box that has a simple black page; my love and passion for programming grew from those early days. And here I am, creating and designing websites and enjoying every aspect of it!  
        I learned coding through completing a six months bootcamp program called ‘She Codes Plus’ in 2020. I continually learn web technologies and other design related topics, currently exploring Javascript and JQuery. Some of my skills in design and development area include:
        HTML5, CSS, Java 
        Dot Net Nuke, Mura CMS, Drupal, Magnolia, Contents 
        Responsive Web Design
        CRM Software (SAP)
        Photoshop and InDesign
        Before starting my career in Marketing, I received my master’s degree in German Literature. I proudly  published my first translated book in 2017. Prior to my advanced German studies, I completed Architectural Drafting courses which lead to my background in construction marketing.
        
        In my spare time I enjoy spending time with my family, lots of reading specially biographies, listening to podcasts and trying new sports (surfing, anyone?).
        
        I am currently based in Perth, Western Australia, and am excited for all the new opportunities the coding world has to offer. I very much look forward to contributing to our local industry!
